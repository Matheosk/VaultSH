# VaultSH

A simple backup script written in bash

It makes a backup of the working directory on ~/.vaultsh

WARNING THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH WIP

## TO-DO

1. ~Restore backup~
2. Delete older backups
3. Config file
4. SSH server support

**If you have any other ideas for a possible feature, feel free to let me know**

## Installation
Just run the ```install.sh``` script and run it with ```vaultsh```.
It update automatically if you already have the script installed
