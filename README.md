# VaultSH

A simple backup script written in bash
It makes a backup of the working directory on ~/.vaultsh

WARNING THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH WIP

## TO-DO

1. Restore backup
3. Delete older backups
2. Config file

**If you have any other ideas for a possible feature, feel free to let me know**

## Installation
Just run the ```install.sh``` script and run it with ```vaultsh```
